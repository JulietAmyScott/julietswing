				<h1>Racing</h1>
				<p>I began racing with Chuckwalla Valley Racing Association in October of 2015. That first weekend, I achieved two 2nd place podium wins for each of the Femmewalla races (an all women race). Since that time, I have won multiple podiums with CVMA. I also attained a 3rd place championship for the Winter Series of 2016-2017. And starting this October, I will be racing continuously through the end of the series in April.</p>

				<h1>Coaching</h1>
				<p>It’s been a fantastic experience for me to instruct beginning and intermediate motorcycle riders on how to improve their riding skills on and off the track. Since I began with Let’s Ride Track Days, I have attended nearly every track day they have hosted. I look forward to coaching with Let’s Ride in the coming year.</p>

				<h1>Track Days</h1>
				<p class="paddingBottom">I also guest ride with track organizations on a regular basis. This is a great opportunity to visit a variety of racetracks including Chuckwalla, Laguna Seca, Buttonwillow, and Willow Springs. I also attend Femmewalla (an all women’s track day) each year to raise funds for the non-profit The Unforgettables.</p>

				<p class="paddingBottom">I would be proud to showcase Liqui Moly at the motorcycle track events throughout the year. And it would be a privilege for me to represent such an exceptional product.</p>

				<p class="paddingBottom">Thank you for considering me for sponsorship in the upcoming year.</p>
